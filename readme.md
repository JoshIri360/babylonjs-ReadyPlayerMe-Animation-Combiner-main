Babylon JS & ReadyPlayerMe -- <b>Combining multiple animations to a ReadyPlayerMe Character</b>
<br>
<br>
Used animations from:
<br>
https://github.com/readyplayerme/animation-library

<br>
And converted from FBX to GLB using this simple NodeJS APP:
<br>

<br>
<br>
Of course, current Player is from <b>ReadyPlayerMe</b>
<br>
Animations use Blending 
<br>
